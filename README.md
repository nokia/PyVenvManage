# PyVenvManage

NOTE: This project is moved to [pyvenvmanage/PyVenvManage](https://github.com/pyvenvmanage/PyVenvManage) and maintained

## Introduction

<!-- Plugin description -->
**PyVenvManage** is a plugin for managing the Python interpreter of Pycharm Projects.

It is a general issue that Python projects may have several interpreters in different
virtual environments for the various versions of the language. Managing these venvs
is easily done with `tox`, but configuring the project in Pycharm is painful.

With PyVenvManage the selection and setup of the venv is a few clicks without dialog boxes.

## Features

- Popup menu item to set the project interpreter
- Icon provider to indicate virtual environments in the project view
